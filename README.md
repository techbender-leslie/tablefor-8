<em>"The idea was born out of a genuine wish to bring people together under optimal conditions for good company and a good meal. Small groups are always the best for memorable evenings. An optimal evening will involve 2 appetizers, 3 side dishes, 2 main dishes and 1 dessert. Six bottles of wine, non-alcoholic beverages, music in style with the evening's cuisine, low lighting, and a comfortable environment. It is then, we can truly unwind and appreciate each ohter"
TechBender Leslie, Founder of TableFor:8</em>

### But what is it exactly?

Designed for groups of 6 or 8, which studies have shown is the optimal amount of people to have where everyone feels welcome and the conversation flows freely
It is for people who love to make and eat good food, but don't need to label themselves, and certainly not food snobs
A night for people to savour great conversation and explore complex topics
In an comfortable environment that is relaxed, warmly lit, with good music and good smells
